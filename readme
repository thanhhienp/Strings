------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No, because the pointers or array destination pointers passed to the
function does not contain any metadata about the length of the array or
the memory area where the string is stored, only the address to where
that memory area is. The check for the size of the destination memory
area can only be performed in the client program where it has more
information.
